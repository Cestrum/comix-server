Originally it was made to run on the Synology NAS.  However,\r\nit can run on any platforms where Apache HTTP Server runs, such as\r\nUbuntu Linux or OSX.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to download\r\n\r\nGo to http://song31.github.com/comix-server/ and click the tar.gz or\r\nzip folder icons in the page.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to install\r\n\r\nYou can find a step-by-step guide at \r\nhttps://github.com/song31/comix-server/wiki/Step-by-Step-Configuration-Guide  \r\n\r\nIn short,\r\n- Log in to the Synology DSM and make a shared folder, for example, named\r\n  \"manga\". This directory will be your manga directory.\r\n- Enable SSH.\r\n- Unzip the downloaded file and copy all to the \"web\" folder (/var/services/web, default DocumentRoot).\r\n- Connect to your Synology server using SSH and do the remaining steps.\r\n- Copy conf/httpd.conf-comix to /usr/syno/apache/conf/.\r\n- Add the following line, \"Include /usr/syno/apache/conf/httpd.conf-comix\", \r\n  without quotes of course, at the end of /usr/syno/apache/conf/httpd.conf and \r\n  /usr/syno/apache/conf/httpd.conf-user. \r\n- Add the manga directory's path to the open_basedir variable in\r\n  /usr/syno/etc/php/user-setting.ini.\r\n- Reboot the Synology server.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\n\r\nThe Apache HTTP process automatically starts and is always running on the Synlogy server.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\n- Copy your comic collection to the manga directory.\r\n- Start AirComix app on your iPhone/iPad and add your Synology server. \r\n  Use the default port number, 31251.\r\n- Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\nQ) Do I need to uncompress ZIP files?  \r\nA) No. Like Windows version, comix-server supports ZIP files.\r\n\r\nQ) How can I change the port number?  \r\nA) See /usr/syno/apache/conf/httpd.conf-comix.\r\n\r\nQ) How can I change the manga directory?  \r\nA) See handler.php. You need to modify handler.php, index.php, user-setting.ini, \r\n   and httpd.conf-comix.\r\n\r\nQ) Does comix-server support other archive formats such as RAR or CBR?  \r\nA) No. Current version only supports ZIP (or CBZ).\r\n\r\nQ) Does comix-server support password protection?  \r\nA) Yes, using Apache's basic authentication mechanism. Refer to\r\n   http://www.cs.duke.edu/csl/faqs/web/basic-auth to know how to\r\n   configure it. Note that the user name should be AirComix (case\r\n   sensitve) and .htaccess file should be in /var/services/web where\r\n   handler.php exists. If there is no htpasswd util in your system, you can\r\n   create the password file on other machines and copy it to\r\n   your system.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to contribute\r\n\r\nBug reports and pull requests are always welcomed.\r\n\r\n"}
